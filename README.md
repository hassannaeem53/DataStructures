### Singly Linked List
<p>
   It is the simplest type of linked list in which every node contains some data and a pointer to the next node of the same data type. The node contains a pointer to the next node means that the node stores the address of the next node in the sequence. A single linked list allows the traversal of data only in one way.

### Doubly Linked List
<p>
  A doubly linked list or a two-way linked list is a more complex type of linked list which contains a pointer to the next as well as the previous node in sequence, Therefore, it contains three parts are data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node.
